Analysis of the Relationship Between CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels and Global Temperatures

Description:

This repository houses a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding the correlation between anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels and global temperature variations. Utilizing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), this project employs statistical techniques to explore the impact of fossil fuel emissions on climate change.

Key Features:

Data Integration: Compilation of yearly global average temperatures and CO2 emissions data spanning from 1980 to 2014.
Statistical Analysis: Calculation of mean, variance, covariance, and the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between CO2 emissions and global temperatures.
Visualization: Graphical representation of trends in CO2 emissions and global temperatures, including a linear regression model to illustrate their correlation.
Insights and Implications: Discussion of the findings in the context of climate science, with implications for environmental policy and future research directions.
Objective:

The goal of this analysis is to provide a quantitative basis for understanding how increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are related to changes in global temperatures. By establishing a strong positive correlation, this work underscores the urgency of addressing fossil fuel emissions through comprehensive climate policies and innovations in sustainable energy.
